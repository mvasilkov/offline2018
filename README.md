# You have to get off line

A video game for the js13kGames competition, written in TypeScript.

> "You have to get off line" is a game about walking a fine line, about four pixels thick, between lasers and more lasers.
>
> Follow the story line to its conclusion through obstacles, of which there are many, to get off line, and into a vast directionless yonder (sold separately).
>
> Controls: press Spacebar a lot. On a phone, tap on the screen instead.
